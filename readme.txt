This directory contains the documentation and software implementation of the Electromechanic rail model digitalization, based on ETCS principles.
The project was realised as Bachelor of Computer Science thesys.

To recreate the project, one needs to understand the documentation, and recreate the hardware components presented there.
With the correct hardware configuration, the code base found here can be used.
